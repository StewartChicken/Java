 * Guitar Trainer
 * Evan Poon
 * December 10, 2022
 * 
 * This project was written with the hopes of helping me learn my way around the guitar
 * There will be three main practice features:
 * Chord Practice
 * Note Practice
 * 
 * The Chord Practice feature will give me a random chord that I must play within
 * a given amount of time (Depends on the input BPM)
 * 
 * The Note Practice Feature will give me a random note on a random string and
 * I will need to find its correct location on the fret board
 * 
 * I will also include a feature that allows me to change the BPM of each practice session, 
 * as well as a feature to change which collection of notes/chords I am practicing
